          Vacation Planner: Full MERN Stack Group Project
        </h2>
        <p>
          My group utilized an Apollo Server, GraphQL, React and MongoDB to
          complete this Full Stack Web Application. The front end is composed of
          React components with Higher Level JavaScript functionality, to link
          our MongoDB data into a cohesive and intuitive Front End Design. The
          React components are styled with Bootstrap CSS Framework that is
          consistent throughout the application to enhance the user experience
          of this application. Users can sign in as a new user or log in as a
          returning user, view our Activity offerings, and add them to their
          profile. On the profile page, users will see their personal
          information paired with their Activity selections. From there, the
          user can delete activities, if desired. This data is persisted in the
          back end.

        <p>
          For this project, I was the scrum master for our group, while also
          completing the Full Stack GraphQL capabilities. I utilized and revised
          the back end typeDefs and resolvers in order to utilize queries and
          mutations that I created in the front end, to call data into the react
          components and populate on the webpage. I also created the sample data
          and completed the Authentication functionality of the Sign Up and
          Login features.

          Town Hall: Full Stack MySQL Group Project
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our group used Node.js, Express.js routing, and a MySQL database, to
          create a RESTful API. We used Handlebars.js as the front end
          framework, paired with the Tailwind CSS Framework and DaisyUI
          components. The profile images are generated from a third party API.
          We used Insomnia to test routes and Workbench to create models and
          ensure the functionality of the Express routes. We used Github to host
          our repository and Heroku to deploy our solution.

          For this project, all members worked with a commitment to Agile
          Methodologies. My technical contributions include: creating a
          functional front end with Handlebars.js, styling with Tailwind CSS
          Framework and DaisyUI components, Front End Functionality, Sign Up and
          Login Forms (not including Auth functionality), and Express routes.

          Event Forecast Planner: Third Party API Integration, Front End Group
          Project
        </h2>
        <p>
          The motivation to create this application came from the groupâ€™s
          interest in outdoor activities and events, with the real world problem
          of weather variation affecting the experience of those events. This
          project was built to allow the User to find events in their desired
          location, while also including a weather forecast to allow the User to
          plan for that event accordingly. This solves the problem of allowing
          the user to make an informed decision about going to an outdoor event,
          travel plans, and more. The group learned how to integrate multiple
          API's in javascript, and style the received information with a new (to
          us) CSS framework, Foundation. The group learned how to delegate and
          collaborate on project elements to create fairness in workload and
          highlight the strengths of each group member. The group also learned
          how make individual working branches on github, complete pull
          requests, and then approve and merge those requests into our main
          branch.

          JavaScript Quiz: Front End Javascript
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have attempted to create an interactive JavaScript quiz utilizing
          original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements. This project intends to
          showcase the skills that I have learned in JavaScript. This webpage
          features an EventListener() on the start button, prompting the quiz to
          begin by presenting the first question and starting a timer. The
          answer buttons are interactive. The timer is affected by the user's
          answer choices. When the timer runs out, the endGame() functions are
          run to alert the user that the game is over, and providing an area for
          the user to input their initials to be displayed on the HighScore
          board. The initials and score are saved in local storage, which can be
          seen when you inspect the page. Throughout development, I learned the
          complexity of creating multiple interactive elements on one webpage.

          E-Commerce Back End: Back End MySQL with Sequelize
        </h2>
        <p>
          I created this E-Commerce Backend in order to create an interactive
          database to store my store's inventory data. I am able to view product
          Categories, Products, and Tags. I am able to add Categories, Products,
          or Tags, and update existing data, as desired, using Insomnia as the
          interactive space. This application utilizes Node, Express,js to
          create the application routes, MySQL and Sequelize to create, seed and
          update the database, as well as the relational capabilities of MySQL
          when desired. I learned how to improve coding structure and
          accessibility of MySQL databases utilizing Sequelize models, refined
          my knowledge of Express.js routes, and conducted testing of routes and
          database capabilities with Insomnia.
