      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Full Stack JavaScript Engineer interested in Full Stack job
        opportunities to continue growth and learning in the field. I have
        completed a 24-week coding bootcamp and apprenticeship, where I learned
        the basics of Full Stack Web Development, gaining technical programming
        skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, MySQL,
        MongoDB, Express, Handelbars.js, and ReactJS. I personally specialize in
        front-end Javascript, API integration, API creation with SQL or MongoDB,
        and Express.js Controllers and Routes in the backend. I have enjoyed
        utilizing my communication and community-building skills gained in my
        career as a Social Worker to collaborate with classmates using Agile
        Methodologies. I take pride in my work, including producing
        user-friendly designs and effective functioning, presenting projects and
        public speaking, and learning new technologies along the way. I bring an
        easy-going personality combined with a dedication to success to all team
        projects. I love to work hard with a smile. In my spare time I compete
        in Powerlifting, value time with my family, and am learning to speak
        fluent Spanish.
